# UniversityProjects
This repository contains some projects created while studying Data Science and Business Analytics @Hochschule der Medien in Stuttgart (Germany).

The projects created during this time will be organized in folders within this GitHub repository. If possible I will upload a presentation as a pdf-file and the code, 
used to create the content for this project additionally. Some projects contain sensitive data and/or no code. In those cases I will only share the content, what is 
possible and allowed respecting the underlying data governance.

Not even all published projects has been created by me on my own. Sometimes it is a result of a project created by a group of students.

In case of any questions regarding a specific project or some details, please get in touch and we can discuss persoally.

Best greetings
